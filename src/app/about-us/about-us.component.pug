          | We're a minecraft community with a focus on the technical and aesthetic side of the game
          | our goal has always been to give our members an unique experience inside of the game and
          | have a good time with eachother, we were founded on June 2015 by _Dani under the name of
          | "VoidCrafters", since then, we've collected enough data based on trial and error to bring
          | you a private server as healthy and entertaining as possible, we've seen what works and
          | what does not work over all this time and we're confident that this will be a long-term
          | server for you to enjoy alongside the other community members.

          | As we mentioned earlier with our introduction, we've been around for quite a while and we
          | have invested hundreds of hours to hundreds of proyects, either personal or colective ones,
          | We'd like to give you a glimpse of some of the things we did on Qbitmc's season 4 which started
          | right after the innovation of a couple administrative processes and left the second name in
          | which we were acknowledged by: "nms" in
          |

        p
          | After a couple of months, that season ended due to a new proyect we were working on where we wanted
          | to completely change in which we played, opening a bigger public server but we started to deviate
          | from our roots and remembered that all of this was made with the community and the sense of it in mind
          | that made us abandon that proyect and start the fifth season of our SMP which was the first one to
          | have non-vanilla mechanics alike to those implemented in the HermitCraft series
          |
          a(href="https://imgur.com/a/dSfBL") (here's an album with some screenshots of said season)
        p
          | That should be enough history and media for you to get an idea of the work we do here, we have a lot
          | of ideas and plans in mind and we're sure that the seventh season of our survival will be quite special
          | if you'd like to know more about it, keep on reading!
